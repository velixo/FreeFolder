~~ Trello: https://trello.com/b/HBpCsYul/realtime-file-sync ~~

Scratch that above. Trello is not currently being used, I would recommend looking at stories.md instead to see what stories are implemented and whats left. By stories I mean the same kind of stories that are used in Agile development, such as XP.

A program written in Java that periodically syncs your files with a to-be-developed
server program.

The program doesn't track files in one single folder, but instead tracks and syncs files
anywhere on your computer that are set to be tracked in the main program window.
